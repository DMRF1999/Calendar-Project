# Calendar-Project
## By Damian Fletcher
### Completed as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp

## Live Site: https://dfcalendarproject.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies:
* Express
* MongoDB
* bcrypt
* Passport
* Heroku

## Future Goals
Right now the events aren't tied to the User, so everyone can see and edit all events.  In the future I would like to connect events to whatever user is logged in as well as attach them to the calendar day.

## User Stories
* As a user I would like to register
* As a user I would like a secure login
* As a user I would like to add events
* As a user I would like to edit events
* As a user I would like to delete events
